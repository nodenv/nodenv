== Name

nodenv - manage your application's Node.js environment

== Synopsis

*nodenv* _<command>_ [_<args>_...]

== Description

nodenv respects the _.node-version_ file in a project directory by making sure that any *node*, *npm*, *npx*, or other Node.js command invocation automatically invokes the Node.js version configured for that project.

It does so by generating shims for all Node.js executables. As long as nodenv shims directory is prepended to PATH, nodenv automatically ensures transparent switching between Node.js versions.

nodenv looks for available Node.js versions in the _$NODENV_ROOT/versions_ directory.

== Commands

*nodenv global* [_<version>_]::
  View or change the global Node.js version

*nodenv local* [_<version>_]::
  View or change the local Node.js version

*nodenv shell* [_<version>_]::
  View or change the Node.js version for the current shell session

*nodenv version*::
  View the currently active Node.js version and where it is set from

*nodenv versions*::
  List all locally installed Node.js versions known to nodenv

*nodenv install* [_<version>_]::
  (Provided by the *node-build* plugin) Download and install a new Node.js version

*nodenv rehash*::
  Regenerate shims for all known Node.js executables

*nodenv which* [_<command>_]::
  View the executable path that a command resolves to

*nodenv init*::
  Help bootstrap nodenv into the current shell environment

*nodenv help* [_<command>_]::
  View help text for any nodenv command

== Environment Variables

*NODENV_VERSION* (default: read from _.node-version_ file)::
  The Node.js version name to be used

*NODENV_ROOT* (default: _~/.nodenv_)::
  The location where nodenv discovers Node.js versions, plugins, and other configuration

*NODENV_DEBUG*::
  Activates printing debug information about nodenv internals to standard error

*NODENV_HOOK_PATH*::
  Colon-separated list of paths searched for nodenv plugin scripts

*NODENV_DIR* (default: _$PWD_)::
  Directory to traverse bottom-up to locate the _.node-version_ file

== Plugins

As its core functionality, nodenv only switches between Node.js versions and does nothing else, but offers a plugin mechanism to hook into and override almost any aspect of its default behavior.

The most common plugin for nodenv is *node-build* which facilitates installing new Node.js versions into the _$NODENV_ROOT/versions_ directory.
